Figuring out Github

Hello, my name is Kylen Williams and I'm a 15 year-old programmer. I know python and C++ and I am very interested in mathematics (a numberphile if you will ;). I am currently exploring branches of machine learning, I am semi fluent in reinforcemnt learning and image classification, and I am currently learning natural language proccessing (NLP). I decided to learn about all three of those to see which I like most so I could focus specifically on that one, but they all seem equally interesting right now and I plan on doing Kaggle competitions, and other personal projects, with all three types. Thanks for reading!
